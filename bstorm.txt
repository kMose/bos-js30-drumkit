Event listener pass keycode into function
    check the data-key for each element
        65 = A = clap;
        83 = S = hihat;
        68 = D = kick;
        70 = F = openhat;
        71 = G = boom;
        72 = H = ride;
        74 = J = snare;
        75 = K = tom;
        76 = L = tink;

create function that takes datakey as an argument
    plays the requesite data-key:sound pairing.

playSound(data-key)

switch (playSound){
    case 65:
        play clap.wav;
    case 83:
        paly hihat;
}


this function needs to have two things. the key being pressed and the sound
being played by the keypress.


    const inputField = document.querySelector("body");
    let soundBuffer = "";

    inputField.addEventListener("keydown", (key) => {
        console.log(`you pressed ${key.keyCode}`);
        playSound(key.keyCode);
    });

function playSound(keyCode){
    soundBuffer = document.querySelector("audio[data-key="keyCode"]")
    soundBuffer.play();

}
